## CSS Flexbox and Grid

Before starting this assignment, make sure you have completed Flexbox Froggy (https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and Grid Garden (https://cssgridgarden.com/) on your own. You will need screenshots showing that you completed these in your submission.

You will also need to take the mid-semester survey to get full credit for this assignment. https://forms.gle/pLkk3u5Sh9m7Qy289

I would strongly recommend watching this video before starting the assignment, it's a great way to see how similar problems are approached using Flexbox vs Grid. https://youtu.be/aEj6k-gi9-s

Create a GitHub repo for this assignment named `is120-hw6-firstname-lastname`.

Build a single web page using CSS Grid for page layout and CSS Flexbox for individual component structure. Use any topic or filler content you like.

Your Grid layout might look something like this:

<img src="../assets/images/grid-layout.png" alt="Grid Layout" width="400"/>

- Use `grid-template-areas` to define four named areas: `header`, `main`, `sidebar`, `footer`.
- Use `grid-template` to control the sizing of these areas.
- Use Flexbox in your `header` for navigation links and a page title.
- Use Flexbox in your `main` to arrange 3 cards. The cards should use Flexbox internally as well.
- Use Flexbox in your `sidebar` to stack additional links vertically.
- Use Flexbox in your `footer` to display your name and the date for this assignment on opposite ends of the `footer`.

In your `README.md` include the following:

- Screenshots showing that you have completed Flexbox Froggy and Grid Garden on your own
- Write "SURVEY COMPLETED" if you have taken the mid-semester survey
- Explain the difference between Flexbox and Grid. What use cases is each one better suited for?
- Do you like Flexbox or Grid better? Why?
