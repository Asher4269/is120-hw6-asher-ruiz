## Changes Made

I added breakpoints for mobile and laptop/tablet versions and assumed the general display of desktop since that is how I initially built it.
Most of my changes were made to the grid and flex layouts. A lot of my changes involved adjusting the general grid-areas and switching flex-direction to column and adjusting
positioning after as needed.
As you mentioned, this process was painful, and in the future, I would absolutely design the app from a mobile first POV.

Unfortunately, the Images were hard to get perfect for this assignment. I picked a janky, ai-generated image for my 3 cards, which ended up hurting my responsive design since the images do a bad job of stretching. For future webpages, I would probably design my cards from the get-go with better responsive image patterns in mind.

## Custom Breakpoints:

I used tailwind breakpoints for mobile edition and tablets as my breakpoint pixel values. I found these on w3 schools, specifically the page about media queries.
Custom Breakpoint variables were tough to figure out.

## How would I have built this page differently

I think I honestly would have built this page from mobile and expanded it out to be a desktop page. Widdling it down was harder than I imagined.
I think I will keep this mindset from now on with all pages that won't naturally just be desktop type websites/applications.

Upon messing with the page by changing my viewport size with the bottom right shrinker and expander option of the mouse, I quickly found out that while my breakpoints add some
awesome responsiveness, there are still other breakpoint gaps that need to be filled. It looks like based on the niche design of my cards and icons, I would probably need to add more specific breakpoints for more viewport sizes
An example would be getting down into mobile, tablet, laptop, small desktop, and large desktop. This would help it out a lot more in the future.

Homework 6: CSS Flexbox and Grid

## Screenshots of Completion

## Survey

SURVEY COMPLETED

## FlexBox v. Grid

### FlexBox

FlexBox is best for items within containers. Obviously this depends as well, but it is good with containers found in a search or items in a store because of how naturally responsive it is.

### Grid

Grid is best when it comes to page layouts. It allows precise control over where containers go and how they behave.

### Key Differences

I feel like Grid is great when you want something solid like a layout, while FlexBox is great when you need something to adjust well with the page.

### My Preference

While FlexBox feels easier to code, I know I should lean more towards learning Grid. Grid feels like the skeleton of the page.

## Icons

I feel like if I could get rid of the white background in my icons, the website would look a lot smoother.
