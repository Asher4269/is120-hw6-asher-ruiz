## FlexBox v. Grid

### FlexBox

FlexBox is best for items within containers. Obviously this depends as well, but it is good with containers found in a search or items in a store because of how naturally responsive it is.

### Grid

Grid is best when it comes to page layouts. It allows precise control over where containers go and how they behave.

### Key Differences

I feel like Grid is great when you want something solid like a layout, while FlexBox is great when you need something to adjust well with the page.

### My Preference

While FlexBox feels easier to code, I know I should lean more towards learning Grid. Grid feels like the skeleton of the page.

## Icons

I feel like if I could get rid of the white background in my icons, the website would look a lot smoother.
