## Changes Made

I added breakpoints for mobile and laptop/tablet versions and assumed the general display of desktop since that is how I initially built it.
Most of my changes were made to the grid and flex layouts. A lot of my changes involved adjusting the general grid-areas and switching flex-direction to column and adjusting
positioning after as needed.
As you mentioned, this process was painful, and in the future, I would absolutely design the app from a mobile first POV.

## Custom Breakpoints:

I used tailwind breakpoints for mobile edition and tablets as my breakpoint pixel values. I found these on w3 schools, specifically the page about media queries.
Custom Breakpoint variables were tough to figure out.

## How would I have built this page differently

I think I honestly would have built this page from mobile and expanded it out to be a desktop page. Widdling it down was harder than I imagined.
I think I will keep this mindset from now on with all pages that won't naturally just be desktop type websites/applications.

## Survey

SURVEY COMPLETED

## FlexBox v. Grid

### FlexBox

FlexBox is best for items within containers. Obviously this depends as well, but it is good with containers found in a search or items in a store because of how naturally responsive it is.

### Grid

Grid is best when it comes to page layouts. It allows precise control over where containers go and how they behave.

### Key Differences

I feel like Grid is great when you want something solid like a layout, while FlexBox is great when you need something to adjust well with the page.

### My Preference

While FlexBox feels easier to code, I know I should lean more towards learning Grid. Grid feels like the skeleton of the page.

## Icons

I feel like if I could get rid of the white background in my icons, the website would look a lot smoother.
